Bifrost Core
=====================

Setup
---------------------
[Bifrost Core](http://bifrostcoin.io) is the original Bifrost client and it builds the backbone of the network. However, it downloads and stores the entire history of Bifrost transactions; depending on the speed of your computer and network connection, the synchronization process can take anywhere from a few hours to a day or more. Thankfully you only have to do this once.

Running
---------------------
The following are some helpful notes on how to run Bifrost on your native platform.

### Unix

Unpack the files into a directory and run:

- bin/32/bifrost-qt (GUI, 32-bit) or bin/32/bifrostd (headless, 32-bit)
- bin/64/bifrost-qt (GUI, 64-bit) or bin/64/bifrostd (headless, 64-bit)

### Windows

Unpack the files into a directory, and then run bifrost-qt.exe.

### OSX

Drag Bifrost-Qt to your applications folder, and then run Bifrost-Qt.
